# OMDACS
### Online Medical Diagnosis and Concultancy System - ASP.NET MVC Project

- db-script.sql has necessary tables for the project.
- Project has server side validations. They can be with JS to improve server performance. But this way is much safer.
- Also user informations are not hashed. Security is almost none.
- Design of the pages are pure Bootstrap. There are no project based extra CSS. 
- DB tables have no foreign key to have relationship. This is also a negative point.
